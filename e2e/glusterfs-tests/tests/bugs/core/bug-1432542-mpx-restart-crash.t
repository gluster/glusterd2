# GlusterD reports that bricks are started when in fact their attach requests
# might still need to be retried.  That's a bit of a hack, but there's no
# feasible way to wait at that point (in attach_brick) and the rest of the
# code is unprepared to deal with transient errors so the whole "brick start"
# would fail.  Meanwhile, glusterfsd can only handle attach requests at a
# rather slow rate.  After GlusterD tries to start a couple of hundred bricks,
# glusterfsd can fall behind and we start getting mount failures.  Arguably,
# those are spurious because we will eventually catch up.  We're just not
# ready *yet*.  More to the point, even if the errors aren't spurious that's
# not what we're testing right now.  Therefore, we give glusterfsd a bit more
# breathing room for this test than we would otherwise.
