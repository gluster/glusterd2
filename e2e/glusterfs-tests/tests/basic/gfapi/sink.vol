# The sink xlator does not do any memory allocations. It only passes the FOPs
# through to the next xlator.
#
# For testing, there is no next xlator needed, we are only interested in the
# resource usage of the Gluster core when gfapi is used.
#
# Note: The sink xlator does not handle any calls. Mounting is possible, but
# any I/O needs additional functionality in the sink xlator.

# It is possible to test the resource usage of other xlators by adding them in
# the graph before the "sink".
